Exploratoy, Cleaning and Visualizing Data From the Titanic.csv Files

Data cleansing and Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA) is part of CRISP DM on behalf of data preparation. Both are used with the aim of producing clean and credible data. Here's a little explanation of the differences between the two:
## Data Cleansing
Data cleansing is the process of preparing data for analysis by removing or modifying data that is incorrect, incomplete, irrelevant, or duplicated from a reference set, table, or database. This is done so that the data we use does not have a negative effect on the process and data analysis.
## Explanatory Data Analysis
EDA is a process for investigating data and summarizing key insights. This is done to provide a basic understanding of the data, its distribution, zero values, and much more from the data we use. We can explore the data using graphs or through some python functions.
